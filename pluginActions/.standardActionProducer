// @<<<producerName>>>@ is a producer that manages the specialized action 
// @<<<actionName>>>@. The producer is responsible for setting up the action and
// registering it with the @ActionHolder@ service. Furthermore, if the action
// creates some kind of Art-friendly hit class, this producer is responsible
// for getting the hits from the action object and putting them into the event
// or run, as necessary.

// Created by <<<authorName>>>, <<<date>>>

// Art includes
#include "art/Framework/Core/EDProducer.h"
#include "art/Framework/Core/ModuleMacros.h"
#include "art/Framework/Services/Registry/ServiceHandle.h"

// Include the relevant action object
#include "<<<actionLocation>>>"
